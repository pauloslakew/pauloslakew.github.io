<p>
I am interested in planning, environmental and public policy issues that affect airports and 
the broader aviation industry. As an airport consultant, I assess air travel demand and develop 
forecasts of aviation activity at airports. The forecasts I develop are key inputs to airport 
master plans and financial feasibility studies supporting the issuance of bonds to finance airport 
capital projects, including special facilities like consolidated rental car facilities, parking 
structures, and terminals. I also prepare airport economic impact studies and benefit-cost analyses 
for various airport improvement programs.
