<h2>Paulos Ashebir Lakew</h2>
<p>
Management consultant specializing in transportation economics, public policy and environmental issues that affect airports and the broader transportation industry. 
</p>

<h3>Position</h3>
Associate, Economics Market Lead, Steer Group<br>
</br>

I lead the business development and strategic growth of Steer's economics market in North America. I also oversee and 
provide technical support to the aviation, rail and toll road markets on projects involving economic analysis, econometric 
modeling, and traffic and revenue forecasting. Before joining Steer, I worked as an airport consultant at Unison Consulting, 
where I supported senior staff at more than 25 hub airports in the U.S. with forecast development, strategic planning and economic 
analyses for various airport improvement programs. The transportation demand forecasts I developed served as key inputs to airport 
master plans and financial feasibility studies supporting the issuance of bonds to finance airport capital projects, including 
consolidated rental car facilities, parking structures, and terminals.

Prior to consulting, I worked in the public sector as a transportation economist and policy advisor at the California Air Resources Board. 
Collaborating with agency staff in regulatory design and compliance strategy, I prepared economic impact reports on a range of air 
quality and climate regulations. I also assessed costs and benefits associated with proposed actions and planning programs.<br>
